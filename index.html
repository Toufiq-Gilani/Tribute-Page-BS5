                <h2 class="text-center">Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    Khalid ibn al-Walid played a significant role in the early Islamic
                    conquests, leading several successful campaigns against the
                    Byzantine and Sassanid Empires. His military genius and bravery
                    on the battlefield were instrumental in the unification of Arabia
                    under Islam.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Born into a noble family in the Arabian Peninsula, Khalid ibn
                    al-Walid initially opposed Islam and fought against the Muslims
                    in the early stages of the religion. However, after witnessing
                    the strength and unity of the Muslim community, he eventually
                    converted to Islam and became one of the most prominent generals
                    in the Muslim army. He played a crucial role in several battles,
                    including the Battle of Mu'tah, where he was appointed as the
                    commander after the initial Muslim commander was killed in combat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Khalid ibn al-Walid's most significant military achievement was
                    perhaps the Battle of Hunayn, where he led the Muslim army to a
                    decisive victory against a much larger force of Arab tribesmen.
                    He also played a crucial role in the Battle of Uhud, where he led
                    a successful cavalry charge that turned the tide of the battle in
                    favor of the Muslims.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Khalid ibn al-Walid's military campaigns were not only successful
                    but also conducted with a sense of honor and respect for the enemy.
                    He treated prisoners of war humanely and never engaged in
                    unnecessary brutality. His military tactics and strategies are
                    still studied and admired by military historians and strategists
                    around the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, Khalid ibn al-Walid was a legendary figure in
                    Islamic history, whose military prowess and strategic understanding
                    of the battlefield were unmatched. He played a pivotal role in the
                    early Islamic conquests and was instrumental in the unification of
                    Arabia under Islam. His legacy as "The Sword of Allah" continues
                    to inspire and influence military leaders to this day.
